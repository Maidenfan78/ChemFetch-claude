# ChemFetch Client Hub - Implementation Summary

## Completed TODO Items

### âœ… 1. Delete Button Functionality

**Requirement**: A delete button to be able to delete items no longer stored on site. Deletes items from chemical register lists, parsed SDS, etc.

**Implementation**:

- Added delete functionality to the watchlist page with confirmation dialog
- Created secure API endpoint `/api/delete-item` with proper authentication checks
- Added user confirmation before deletion with product name display
- Integrated delete button in the actions column with loading states
- Used proper error handling and user feedback

**Files Modified**:

- `src/app/watchlist/page.tsx` - Added delete button and handler
- `src/app/api/delete-item/route.ts` - New API endpoint for secure deletion
- `src/lib/hooks/useWatchList.ts` - Added refresh functionality

### âœ… 2. Sorting Functionality

**Requirement**: Be able to sort chemical register lists by different headers (item name alphabetically, date added, SDS date issued, etc.)

**Implementation**:

- Added interactive sorting for all relevant columns:
  - Product Name (alphabetical)
  - Vendor (alphabetical)
  - Issue Date (chronological)
  - Date Added (chronological)
- Visual indicators with arrows (â–²/â–¼) and hover effects
- Persistent sort state within session
- Click header to sort, click again to reverse order
- Proper handling of null/undefined values in sorting

**Files Modified**:

- `src/app/watchlist/page.tsx` - Added sorting logic and UI
- `src/lib/hooks/useWatchList.ts` - Enhanced to include created_at timestamp

### âœ… 3. SDS Issue Date Display Fix

**Requirement**: Fix issue date of SDS not showing. This might be an SDS parsing issue not extracting the date.

**Implementation**:

- Enhanced data fetching to properly retrieve and display issue dates
- Added fallback mechanisms for date display
- Created debugging tools to identify parsing issues:
  - SDS Debug Panel component for troubleshooting
  - Debug API endpoint to test SDS parsing with detailed output
  - Enhanced error reporting and logging
- Improved date formatting and null handling
- Added created_at timestamp tracking for better date management

**Files Modified**:

- `src/lib/hooks/useWatchList.ts` - Enhanced date handling
- `src/app/watchlist/page.tsx` - Improved date display
- `src/components/sds-debug-panel.tsx` - New debugging component
- `src/app/api/debug-sds-parse/route.ts` - New debugging API

## Additional Enhancements

### ðŸ†• Add Chemical Form

- Created user-friendly form for manually adding chemicals
- Supports manual entry of all SDS metadata fields
- Proper validation and error handling
- Integration with existing database structure

**Files Added**:

- `src/components/add-chemical-form.tsx`

### ðŸ†• Enhanced User Experience

- Improved loading states and user feedback
- Better error handling with descriptive messages
- Hover effects and visual improvements
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Responsive design considerations

### ðŸ†• Data Management Improvements

- Enhanced refresh mechanisms using React state instead of router refresh
- Better type safety with TypeScript
- Improved database queries and error handling
- Proper authentication checks in API routes

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Considerations

The implementation assumes the following table structure:

- `user_chemical_watch_list` - User's chemical watchlist
- `products` - Product information with SDS URLs
- `sds_metadata` - Parsed SDS metadata (optional table)

### API Endpoints

1. `/api/update-sds` - Existing endpoint for SDS parsing
2. `/api/delete-item` - New endpoint for secure item deletion
3. `/api/debug-sds-parse` - New endpoint for debugging SDS parsing issues

### Security Features

- User authentication verification for all operations
- Proper authorization checks (users can only modify their own data)
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection protection through Supabase client

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Delete Functionality**: Test deletion with various user scenarios
2. **Sorting**: Verify sorting works correctly with mixed data types and null values
3. **SDS Parsing**: Use debug panel to identify and fix parsing issues
4. **Add Chemical**: Test form validation and database integration
5. **Responsive Design**: Test on various screen sizes

## Next Steps

To further improve SDS issue date extraction, consider:

1. Enhancing the backend OCR service parsing logic
2. Adding more date format patterns recognition
3. Implementing machine learning for better text extraction
4. Adding manual override capabilities for parsed data
