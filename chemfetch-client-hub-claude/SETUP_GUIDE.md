# ChemFetch Client Hub - Fix Implementation Steps

## After updating the files, follow these steps:

1. **Stop the development server** (Ctrl+C if running)

2. **Clear npm cache and reinstall dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd chemfetch-client-hub-claude
   npm cache clean --force
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. **Clear browser data:**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Application/Storage tab
   - Clear all cookies and local storage for localhost:3001
   - Or simply use Incognito/Private browsing

4. **Restart the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Expected Results:
✅ No more "cookies() should be awaited" errors
✅ No more "Invalid Refresh Token" errors
✅ Login functionality should work properly
✅ Proper authentication flow
✅ Compatible with Next.js 15

## Key Changes Made:
- Replaced `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` with `@supabase/ssr`
- Updated `supabase-server.ts` to properly await cookies() call
- Updated middleware to use new Supabase SSR client
- Fixed authentication state management
- Added proper error handling and loading states

## If you still have issues:
1. Make sure your Supabase project is active and the URL/keys are correct
2. Check that you have a user account in your Supabase auth table
3. Verify your Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies are properly configured
4. Try creating a new test user via the register page
5. Check the browser network tab for any API errors

## Testing the Fix:
1. Go to http://localhost:3001
2. You should be redirected to /login
3. Try logging in with existing credentials
4. If successful, you should see the dashboard with "Welcome, [email]"
5. Check browser console - should be no errors

## Troubleshooting:
- If you get "Invalid login credentials" - the user might not exist in Supabase
- If middleware errors persist - clear all browser data and restart
- For RLS errors - check your Supabase policies allow user access
